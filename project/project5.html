  <h1 class="project-title">PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE</h1>
  <p class="project-type">Live Project · Frontend Development & UI Design</p>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      I built this portfolio to showcase my design and frontend development skills.
      It reflects my minimalist aesthetic and focus on clarity, interactivity, and structure.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Portfolio builders felt restrictive, and template sites lacked personality.
      I wanted a portfolio that was lightweight, fast, fully custom, and represented me—both as a designer and a developer.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      Full-Stack Designer — handled everything from layout, typography, color system, responsiveness, and vanilla JS interactions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, Photoshop</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>UX Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      I structured content to be scannable and prioritized accessibility. The layout adjusts smoothly on mobile,
      and the color system meets WCAG contrast requirements.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, alt text for all icons, and responsive touch targets 
      were all implemented to ensure usability for all users.
    </p>
  </div>

    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Add blog functionality, dark mode toggle, and project filtering.
      I’m also exploring turning this into a lightweight static site generator.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Building my site helped reinforce best practices in accessibility, performance, and clean code.
      It was a rewarding challenge that reflects both my personal style and technical strengths.
