    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      Designed a clean, desktop-friendly interface for a fictional insurance platform focused on quick access 
      to essential features. The prototype aimed to simplify navigation while maintaining trust and clarity in a visually complex domain.

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Insurance websites are often cluttered, slow, and hard to navigate, especially when users are just trying 
      to register or access basic policy information. This project aimed to create a streamlined interface 
      that eliminates friction and enhances clarity for both new and returning users.

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      UI/Visual Designer — planned the layout, created the user flow, and designed the interface using clean visuals and intuitive forms.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The UI was built around clarity and ease of use. Step-by-step navigation (stepper design) made the process 
      feel manageable. Required fields were marked clearly with icons and colors that stand out without being 
      harsh. Error messages are direct and placed next to the related input, reducing user confusion.

  <h2>UX Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The design focused on guiding users smoothly through a multi-step process using a visual stepper. I minimized cognitive load
    by showing only relevant fields per step, used clear inline validation to reduce form errors, and added microcopy for
    field hints. Required fields were visually emphasized without overwhelming the interface. The goal was to make
    insurance form completion feel easy, not intimidating.

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Future iterations would include more complex flows like policy lookup, document uploads, and help chat integration. 
      I’d also like to conduct usability tests with users unfamiliar with insurance platforms to test the effectiveness 
      of the guided registration process.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Designing this prototype reinforced the importance of reducing user friction, especially in industries like insurance 
      where forms can feel like a chore. By stripping out unnecessary elements and guiding the user step-by-step, 
      the UI becomes less of a task and more of a helpful assistant.
