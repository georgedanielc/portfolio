    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
	   A minimalistic mobile ordering experience for a fictional coffee brand, “Third Mug.” Focused on clean UI, simple interactions, and a smooth ordering flow.

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
	  Most coffee apps are cluttered and slow for quick orders. This concept streamlines the process, removing distractions and guiding users through an efficient, focused flow.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      High contrast colors, large readable fonts, and finger-friendly tap targets were prioritized. Visual clutter was reduced to improve focus and reduce cognitive load.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="project-section">
  <h2>UX Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The core focus was on reducing user effort in a mobile ordering flow. I prioritized large, tappable elements for easy thumb use, 
    a linear ordering path to eliminate confusion, and clear confirmation states. Only the essential screens were included, 
    removing clutter and letting users complete an order in just a few taps. Icons and labels were paired to support both recognition and clarity.

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Designed a linear flow with large tappable elements for easy thumb use, minimal screens, and clear confirmation states. Paired icons with labels for faster recognition.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
       Plan to conduct user testing with on-the-go customers to validate efficiency. Future features could include loyalty rewards and order history.
