    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      A minimalistic mobile ordering experience designed for a fictional coffee brand, "Third Mug." 
      The focus is on clean UI, intuitive interaction, and seamless user flow in a mobile context.
    </p>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Many coffee shop apps are cluttered and overwhelming for users who just want to place a quick order.
      This concept solves that by simplifying the ordering process—removing distractions and guiding users
      through a straightforward, focused experience.

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      UI Designer — handled wireframing, prototyping, and visual design of the ordering flow.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      I used a high contrast between text and background to maintain readability in any lighting.
      Fonts are large and clean to support quick scanning. Interactive elements are finger-friendly in size.
      Visual clutter was intentionally avoided to reduce cognitive load.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="project-section">
  <h2>UX Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The core focus was on reducing user effort in a mobile ordering flow. I prioritized large, tappable elements for easy thumb use, 
    a linear ordering path to eliminate confusion, and clear confirmation states. Only the essential screens were included, 
    removing clutter and letting users complete an order in just a few taps. Icons and labels were paired to support both recognition and clarity.
  </p>
 </div>


  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      I’d like to test the prototype with real users, especially commuters or on-the-go coffee drinkers, 
      to validate flow efficiency and identify pain points. Potential features to explore include loyalty rewards
      and order history.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This concept challenged me to remove all non-essential elements while still creating a delightful ordering experience.
      I focused on what matters most—clarity, ease, and flow—and learned how intentional simplicity improves usability.
