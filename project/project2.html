    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      This internal tool was developed in collaboration with the HR department to streamline recruitment.
      Previously, hiring was managed through platforms like LinkedIn and other external job boards.
      This project marked a shift toward hosting job listings and applications directly on the company website,
      offering more control, better branding, and an improved candidate experience.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      The existing recruitment process relied heavily on third-party platforms and manual processing,
      making it inefficient and disconnected. Application forms lacked structure, HR had no centralized database,
      and candidates often didn’t receive timely updates. The goal was to create a dedicated,
      user-friendly portal that automated essential steps and brought the hiring process in-house.

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      WordPress Developer — responsible for plugin development, custom application forms,
      email integration, and close collaboration with HR to implement features tailored to their needs.

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <p>WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SMTP Email Integration</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>UX Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Form fields were grouped logically, with real-time validation and placeholder hints to prevent errors.
      Plain language labels, intuitive navigation, and success/error states improved clarity for applicants.
      I also worked closely with HR to ensure that the interface required minimal training to use.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      All form fields included semantic labels for screen reader compatibility.
      Contrast ratios were tested to ensure readability for visually impaired users.
      Required fields were marked clearly, and error states used color and text to ensure clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Future improvements could include an applicant dashboard, file upload status indicators,
      analytics for HR, and a built-in scheduler for interviews. These additions would continue
      to automate and enhance the recruitment workflow.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This project helped me deepen my WordPress development skills and highlighted the value of cross-functional collaboration.
      Transitioning HR from third-party platforms to an internal tool was a big shift, and seeing them adapt to a more streamlined
      and branded hiring experience was especially rewarding.
