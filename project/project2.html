    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      This internal tool was developed in collaboration with the HR department to streamline recruitment. The project focused on building a custom Job Portal with essential features tailored for talent acquisition.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      The existing recruitment system was inefficient and not user-friendly for either HR personnel or applicants. Manual processing, unclear application forms, and lack of timely feedback slowed down hiring. The goal was to create a centralized, automated solution that simplified and clarified the process for both ends.

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <p>WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SMTP Email Integration</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>UX Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Form fields were grouped logically and used placeholder hints and real-time validation to prevent input errors.
      The job portal navigation was designed to be clear, using plain language labels and feedback messages upon submission.
      I worked with HR to ensure that the interface was easy to understand—even for non-tech-savvy users.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Labels and form elements were semantically structured for screen reader compatibility. 
      High-contrast text and button styling were used to improve readability. Required fields were clearly marked with asterisks and error highlights to aid user understanding.

      A built-in scheduling tool for interviews and status-based email triggers would also enhance workflow automation.

    <p>
      This project helped me strengthen my WordPress development skills, particularly in customizing functionality for specific team workflows.
      It also highlighted the importance of cross-functional collaboration and UX thinking in building tools that are not only functional,
      but also easy and pleasant to use.
