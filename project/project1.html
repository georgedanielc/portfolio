    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      This project explores a bold visual identity for a fictional design conference, “Design Rally 2025.”
      The goal was to experiment with energetic color palettes, dynamic type, and layout hierarchy.
    </p>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Many conference designs feel corporate and visually predictable. “Design Rally 2025” aimed to break
      that mold, creating an expressive, high-energy identity that could appeal to a younger creative audience 
      while still delivering information clearly and accessibly.

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      Visual Designer — responsible for concept development, layout, and presentation design. I designed the poster and visual system
      to reflect the dynamic, forward-thinking spirit of a modern design event.

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <p>Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop</p>

    <h2>UX Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Although this was primarily a visual project, I made sure that the hierarchy of content (event title, date, theme)
      was instantly readable. Text sizing, placement, and rhythm guide the viewer’s eye. The poster design balances
      boldness with legibility to maintain functional communication.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-section">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      High color contrast and bold typography were used to ensure the design remains readable at a distance 
      or when viewed on-screen. Fonts were chosen for their clarity and balance of personality and accessibility. 
      Decorative elements were kept secondary to avoid distracting from core content.

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      I’d like to extend this visual system into other assets like motion graphics, lanyards, signage, and a responsive web landing page. 
      This would round out the full brand experience and test the flexibility of the identity across formats.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Through this project, I explored how type and color can shape emotion and energy in an event setting.
      I learned to balance playfulness with readability, and I enjoyed pushing boundaries without real client constraints.
      It reminded me that strong visual identity doesn't need to sacrifice clarity or function.
