    <strong>George Cavas</strong> is an aspiring UI/UX and product designer who believes good design isn’t just about pretty pixels—it’s about how a user feels, cries, rages, or dances while navigating an interface. He’s obsessed with crafting digital experiences that don’t just work, but *feel* right. Smooth journeys, intuitive clicks, and a sprinkle of joy? That’s his thing.

    When he’s not rearranging buttons for optimal emotional impact, George can be found brewing suspiciously strong coffee, aggressively clicking through video games, or dramatically petting his dog like a cartoon villain—but in a loving way.
